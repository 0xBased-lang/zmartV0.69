# Test Wallet Status & Setup

**Date:** November 12, 2025
**Status:** Partial Setup - Single Wallet Testing Ready

---

## Current Status

### ✅ What We Have

**1. Wallet Generation System:**
- Script created: `scripts/setup-test-wallet-farm.ts`
- Successfully generates 10 test wallet keypairs
- Installed `tsx` for TypeScript execution
- Automated airdrop system (blocked by rate limits)

**2. Existing Funded Wallet:**
```bash
Public Key: 4WQwPjKHu3x7dHBEehBDgxXHJQoDuBvj6Xhu6C1jjTye
Balance: ~22 SOL (devnet)
Source: .env.test (generated by setup-test-wallet.sh)
```

**3. Generated Wallets (Need Funding):**
10 new wallet keypairs generated and ready to fund:
1. `AuAuupXNjuEaxMqG9vCFTk6reHnFr1ks2u2adQfGVGXk`
2. `83C1cJBAJvcsL56znL4mpMtU6AF4N2qurXm5qTLuj1FK`

## ⚠️ Blocker: Devnet Faucet Rate Limiting

**Issue:** Solana devnet faucet has daily limits per IP/wallet.

**Error Message:**
```
429 Too Many Requests: "You've either reached your airdrop limit today
or the airdrop faucet has run dry. Please visit https://faucet.solana.com
for alternate sources of test SOL"
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Cannot auto-fund 10 wallets via script
- ✅ Can proceed with single-wallet testing
- ⏸️ Multi-user concurrent tests blocked until funding

---

## Alternative Funding Options

### Option 1: Web Faucet (Recommended)
Visit https://faucet.solana.com for each wallet address.

**Pros:**
- Different rate limits than RPC airdrop
- May have higher daily allowance
- Can try multiple times throughout the day

**Cons:**
- Manual process (10 wallets × multiple visits)
- Still subject to rate limits

**Steps:**
1. Visit https://faucet.solana.com
2. Enter wallet address (e.g., `AuAuupXNjuEaxMqG9vCFTk6reHnFr1ks2u2adQfGVGXk`)
3. Complete captcha
4. Request 2-5 SOL
5. Repeat for each wallet (spaced out over hours/days)

### Option 2: Transfer from Existing Wallet
Use the funded wallet (`4WQwPjKHu...jTye` with 22 SOL) to fund new wallets.

**Pros:**
- Immediate availability
- No rate limits
- Programmatic

**Cons:**
- Uses existing test SOL (reduces primary wallet balance)
- Need to write transfer script

**Steps:**
```bash
# Create transfer script
pnpm exec tsx scripts/fund-wallets-from-primary.ts

# Transfers 2 SOL to each new wallet from primary wallet
# Cost: 20 SOL + fees (~0.01 SOL total)
# Primary wallet remaining: ~2 SOL
```

### Option 3: Wait 24 Hours
Devnet faucet limits reset daily.

**Pros:**
- Free SOL
- Simple

**Cons:**
- Delays testing by 1 day
- May need multiple days for all 10 wallets

## Adjusted Testing Plan

### Priority 1-3: Single Wallet Tests (Ready Now) ✅

**Can Test Immediately:**
1. Market Lifecycle (6-state FSM)
2. LMSR Formula Validation
3. Fee Distribution (3/2/5 split)
4. Resolution & Payout
5. Program Error Codes
6. Advanced Slippage Scenarios
7. Performance Benchmarks

**Use:** Existing funded wallet (`4WQwPjKHu...jTye`)

**SOL Required:** 5-10 SOL for comprehensive testing

**Estimated Time:** Days 1-4 (16 hours of testing)

### Priority 4: Multi-User Tests (Blocked) ⏸️

**Requires:**
- 10 funded wallets (2-5 SOL each)
- Total: 20-50 SOL across wallets

**Tests Blocked:**
1. Concurrent Trading (10 simultaneous buys)
2. LMSR under concurrent load
3. Multi-user vote submission
4. Race condition testing
5. Order book consistency

**Workaround:**
- Use single wallet with sequential trades
- Simulate concurrency with rapid sequential operations
- Document need for true multi-user testing before prod

**Estimated Time:** Day 5 (8 hours) - **Can defer to next week**

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Priority 1-3 tests immediately:**

1. ✅ We have 22 SOL in primary wallet (sufficient)
2. ✅ All critical path tests are single-wallet
3. ✅ Can achieve 80%+ test coverage without multi-user tests
4. ✅ Multi-user tests are "nice to have" not "must have" for Week 2

**Fund additional wallets in parallel:**
- Use web faucet throughout the week
- Transfer from primary wallet if needed
- Ready for Priority 4 tests by end of week or next week

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Day 1):**
   - Create test market fixtures
   - Configure test data collection
   - Start writing Priority 1 test suites

2. **Background (Throughout Week):**
   - Fund new wallets via web faucet (2-3 per day)
   - Monitor balances: `solana balance <ADDRESS> --url devnet`

3. **End of Week (Day 5):**
   - Assess wallet funding status
   - If 5+ wallets funded: Run multi-user tests
   - If not: Defer to Week 3, proceed with documentation

## Success Criteria (Week 2)

**Minimum (Single Wallet):**
- ✅ 80% test coverage
- ✅ All critical paths validated
- ✅ Performance benchmarks established
- ✅ Documentation complete

**Ideal (Multi-Wallet):**
- ✅ 90% test coverage
- ✅ Multi-user scenarios tested
- ✅ Race conditions validated
- ✅ Concurrent load tested

**Verdict:** Can achieve "Minimum" criteria with single wallet. "Ideal" requires funded wallet farm.
