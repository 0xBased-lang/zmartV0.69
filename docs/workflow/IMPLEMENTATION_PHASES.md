## Overview

### Implementation Philosophy

**Quality > Speed** - We prioritize correctness, security, and maintainability over rapid deployment.

**Evidence-Based** - This plan is built from line-by-line code analysis, not assumptions.

**Phased Approach** - Critical features first (voting), then supporting (backend), then UX (frontend).

**Validation Gates** - No phase advances without passing comprehensive quality checks.

### Project Scope (Option B - V1 MVP)

**✅ Implement (Blueprint + Essentials):**
- All blueprint mechanics (voting, LMSR, resolution, disputes)
- Proposal voting system (like/dislike, 70% threshold)
- Off-chain vote aggregation → on-chain recording
- Minimal discussion system (Supabase database-only, NO IPFS in V1)
- Wallet-only auth (SIWE)
- Basic user profiles (wallet address only)

**❌ Defer to V2 (Social Features & Infrastructure):**
- Twitter OAuth integration
- Advanced reputation scoring algorithm
- Community flagging/moderation system
- Detailed user profiles
- IPFS snapshots for discussion history archival
- Governance token
- Staking mechanics
- DAO features

### Why 14 Weeks (Not 20)

**Original 20-week estimate was inflated because:**
1. 60% already built (LMSR, trading, state machine all work)
2. Clear requirements (no design ambiguity)
3. Proven patterns (Option B scope well-defined)
4. Quality foundation (102 passing tests to build on)

**Realistic breakdown:**
- Voting System: 3 weeks (complex but isolated)
- Backend Services: 4 weeks (straightforward services)
- Integration Testing: 2 weeks (validate what's built)
- Frontend Integration: 3 weeks (UI exists, add Solana)
- Security + Deployment: 2 weeks (audit + launch)

**Total: 14 weeks with 2-week contingency buffer = 16 weeks worst case**

---

## Phase 1: Voting System Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

**Goal:** Complete all voting instructions + ProposalManager program

**Why First:** Voting is the most complex missing piece. Complete it early to reduce risk.

**Success Criteria:** All 18 instructions implemented, ProposalManager program functional, votes aggregate correctly on devnet.

### Week 1: Core Voting Instructions

**Objective:** Implement proposal and dispute vote submission/aggregation

**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ `submit_proposal_vote` instruction (like/dislike recording)
   - Input: ProposalPDA, user wallet, vote choice (like/dislike)
   - Validation: User hasn't voted yet, proposal in PROPOSED state
   - Output: ProposalVote account created

2. ✅ `aggregate_proposal_votes` instruction (backend → on-chain)
   - Input: ProposalPDA, vote counts from backend
   - Validation: Only authorized aggregator can call
   - Logic: If likes >= 70% of total votes → transition to APPROVED
   - Output: Proposal state updated

3. ✅ `submit_dispute_vote` instruction
   - Input: MarketPDA, user wallet, vote choice (support/reject)
   - Validation: Market in DISPUTED state, user has position
   - Output: DisputeVote account created

4. ✅ `aggregate_dispute_votes` instruction
   - Input: MarketPDA, vote counts from backend
   - Validation: Only authorized aggregator can call
   - Logic: If support >= 60% of total votes → overturn resolution
   - Output: Market outcome updated

5. ✅ Unit tests for all 4 instructions (20+ test cases)
   - Happy path: Valid votes recorded correctly
   - Edge cases: Duplicate votes rejected, wrong state rejected
   - Threshold logic: 70% approval, 60% dispute support
   - Access control: Only aggregator can aggregate

**Validation Checklist:**

3. ✅ Aggregation logic implementation
   - Count votes from VoteRecord accounts
   - Calculate percentages (likes/total, support/total)
   - Apply thresholds (70% proposal approval, 60% dispute support)
   - Trigger state transitions

4. ✅ Integration tests (10+ test scenarios)
   - Proposal approval flow: 10 users vote → 7 like → aggregation → APPROVED state
   - Proposal rejection: 10 users vote → 3 like → aggregation → stays PROPOSED

   - Effect: Set is_paused = true, block all trading instructions
   - Output: Protocol paused

3. ✅ `cancel_market` instruction
   - Input: MarketPDA, reason
   - Validation: Only admin can call, market in PROPOSED/APPROVED state
   - Effect: Refund all positions, set state to CANCELLED
   - Output: Market cancelled

4. ✅ Unit tests for all 3 instructions (15+ test cases)
   - Admin access control: Non-admin calls rejected

### Week 8: Full Lifecycle Tests

**Objective:** Test complete market lifecycle flows

**Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Happy path test (full lifecycle)
   - Step 1: User creates market proposal
   - Step 2: 10 users vote (7 like, 3 dislike)
   - Step 3: Vote aggregator triggers → market APPROVED
   - Step 4: Admin activates market → ACTIVE
   - Step 5: 20 users trade (buy YES/NO shares)
   - Step 6: Oracle submits resolution → RESOLVING
   - Step 7: 48h passes → market monitor transitions → FINALIZED
   - Step 8: Users claim winnings
   - Validation: All steps complete successfully, final balances correct

2. ✅ Multi-user test (concurrent trading)
   - Scenario: 10 users trade simultaneously on same market
   - Actions: 50 buy transactions, 30 sell transactions
   - Validation: No race conditions, all transactions succeed, final state consistent
   - Performance: All transactions complete in <30 seconds

3. ✅ Dispute flow test
   - Step 1: Market resolved to YES
   - Step 2: Users submit dispute → DISPUTED
   - Step 3: 20 users vote on dispute (12 support, 8 reject)
   - Step 4: Vote aggregator triggers → outcome overturned to NO
   - Step 5: Market transitions to FINALIZED
   - Validation: Outcome changed correctly, losers don't get paid

4. ✅ Edge cases
   - Zero trades: Market created, approved, resolved with 0 trades → creator refunded
   - Max slippage: User attempts trade with 1% slippage, actual 1.5% → transaction rejected
   - Minimum liquidity: Market with 1 SOL liquidity → trades work but high slippage
   - Double claim: User claims winnings twice → second claim rejected

5. ✅ Error recovery
   - Transaction failure: Simulate RPC failure → retry logic works
   - Network disconnect: Simulate network issue → service auto-reconnects
   - Invalid state: Attempt trade on FINALIZED market → rejected with clear error

**Test Suite Size:** 50+ integration tests

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Happy path test passes (100% success rate over 10 runs)

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas + Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: Voting System Complexity**
- **Risk:** Vote aggregation logic complex, potential for bugs
- **Mitigation:** Prototype in Week 1, extensive unit tests (20+ cases), devnet validation with real votes
- **Contingency:** If aggregation fails, simplify to on-chain voting only (slower but safer)

**Risk 2: Backend Service Coordination**
- **Risk:** 4 services must coordinate correctly, risk of data inconsistency
- **Mitigation:** Integration tests in Week 8 (full lifecycle), monitoring dashboards, dead letter queue for failed jobs
- **Contingency:** Manual intervention procedures documented, admin tools to fix stuck markets

**Risk 3: Frontend Transaction Bugs**
- **Risk:** Wallet integration tricky, transaction errors confuse users
- **Mitigation:** Wallet testing in Week 10, comprehensive error handling, beta testing with 10 users
- **Contingency:** Fallback to CLI tools for power users if UI fails

**Risk 4: Performance Under Load**
- **Risk:** System may not handle 100 concurrent users
- **Mitigation:** Load testing in Week 9, performance benchmarks, auto-scaling infrastructure
- **Contingency:** Rate limiting, queue system for transactions during peak load

**Risk 5: Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk:** Exploits could drain funds
- **Mitigation:** Self-audit, automated tools (Soteria, Sec3), penetration testing, bug bounty program
- **Contingency:** Emergency pause instruction, incident response plan, insurance fund for losses

### Contingency Buffer

**Planned: 14 weeks**
**Buffer: +2 weeks**
**Worst Case: 16 weeks**

**How Buffer is Used:**
- Week 15: Additional testing if Phase 3 finds major bugs
- Week 16: Extended beta testing if community finds issues
