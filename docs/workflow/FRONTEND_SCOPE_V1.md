# ZMART v0.69 - Frontend Scope Definition (Option B)

**Purpose**: Explicit scope boundaries to prevent 180% scope creep
**Pattern Prevention**: Addresses Pattern #2 (Scope Creep Explosion) from lessons-learned
**Timeline Impact**: 3.2X multiplier applied (4 weeks naive → 9 weeks realistic)

## ❌ Explicit "NOT In Scope" for v0.69 (Pattern #2 Prevention)

**RULE**: Moving ANYTHING from this section requires formal scope change process

### User Interface & Experience

## 🎯 3.2X Frontend Multiplier Breakdown

### Why 9 Weeks (Not 4 Weeks)?

**Evidence from lessons-learned**: Previous Zmart frontend scope creep = 180% growth, 7,767 lines vs planned scope

| Component | Naive Estimate | Reality Multiplier | Actual Time |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Base features** (14 items above) | 4 weeks | 1.0x | 4 weeks |
| **Component consistency** | (assumed free) | +0.5x | +2 weeks |
| **Loading/error states** | (assumed free) | +0.2x | +0.8 weeks |
| **Error handling** | (assumed free) | +0.3x | +1.2 weeks |
| **Performance optimization** | (deferred) | +0.3x | +1.2 weeks |
| **E2E testing** | (deferred) | +0.5x | +2 weeks |
| **Polish & UX refinement** | (minimal) | +0.4x | +1.6 weeks |
| **TOTAL** | **4 weeks** | **×3.2** | **≈13 weeks** |

**Adjusted to 9 weeks**: Accounting for learning curve and tool familiarity

## 📋 Requirements Freeze

### Freeze Timeline

- **Week 10**: Final frontend requirements review
- **Week 11**: ❄️ **FREEZE** - No scope changes allowed
- **Weeks 11-19**: Frontend development (frozen scope)
- **Week 20**: Launch preparation

### Exception Process (Rare)

**IF** something is discovered that MUST be in v1:

1. **Document**: Write scope change request (template below)
2. **Assess Impact**: Calculate % timeline extension
3. **Get Approval**: Tech lead + product owner sign off
4. **Update Docs**: Update this file, TODO_CHECKLIST.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md
5. **Communicate**: Notify team of new timeline

**Scope Change Request Template**:

```markdown
## Scope Change Request

**Feature**: [Name]
**Justification**: [Why it's critical for v1]
**Timeline Impact**: +X weeks (or +Y%)
**Alternative**: [What happens if we defer to v2?]
**Approval**: [ ] Tech Lead [ ] Product Owner
```

## 🚧 Moving Items from "Not In Scope" to "In Scope"

**Process** (Pattern #2 Prevention):

1. **Pause development** of current work
2. **Schedule meeting** with tech lead (or self if solo)
3. **Assess impact**:
   - Time required: +X weeks
   - Dependencies: What else must change?
   - Testing impact: Additional test coverage needed?
4. **Make decision**:
   - **Defer to v2**: Add to backlog, continue with v1 scope
   - **Accept scope change**: Extend timeline, update all docs
5. **Document decision** in this file (changelog section below)
6. **Resume development**

---

## 📦 Tech Stack Decisions (Locked for v1)

### Framework & Libraries

| Category | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 14+ (App Router) | Modern, TypeScript-first, excellent DX |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Rapid development, consistent design |
| **UI Components** | shadcn/ui (recommended) | Pre-built, customizable, accessible |
| **State Management** | Zustand or Jotai | Simple, minimal boilerplate |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form | Best performance, great UX |
| **Charts** | Recharts | Simple, React-native, adequate for v1 |
| **Wallet** | @solana/wallet-adapter-react | Standard for Solana |
| **Date Handling** | date-fns | Lightweight, tree-shakeable |
| **Notifications** | react-hot-toast | Simple, customizable |

**Rule**: No additional libraries without explicit approval (prevents bloat)

## ⚠️ Early Warning Signs (Pattern #2 Prevention)

**STOP IMMEDIATELY if you see**:

✋ "Oh, I forgot we also need..." (after freeze)
✋ "While we're at it, let's add..." (scope creep!)
✋ "This feature is more complex than expected" (didn't estimate right)
✋ Adding features to "Not In Scope" list during development
✋ Building custom components when library version exists

**Red Flag Phrases**:
- "Just a quick feature..."
- "It's only a few lines..."
- "We should probably have..."
- "I assumed this was included..."

**Recovery**:
1. Document the feature in backlog (v2)
2. Continue with current scope
3. Review scope doc (this file) to confirm boundaries

## 📊 Scope Tracking

### Current Status

| Scope Category | Original | Current | Growth |
|----------------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Core Features** | 14 items | 14 items | 0% |
| **Timeline** | 4 weeks naive | 9 weeks realistic | 125% (expected with 3.2X) |
| **NOT In Scope** | 35 items | 35 items | 0% |

**Goal**: Maintain 0% scope growth through v1 development

### Weekly Scope Review (Fridays)

□ Any items moved from "Not In Scope" to "In Scope"? (Should be 0)
□ Any new features added to "In Scope"? (Should be 0)
□ Any scope creep indicators detected? (Should be 0)
□ Timeline still on track? (9 weeks, Weeks 11-19)
